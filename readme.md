## Overview
TikTek is a mobile app created on a project regarding the Mobile Computing course. Its main functionalities include buying event tickets and ordering from the theater cafeteria, offering an immersive experience for customers. 

## Architecture

A solid architecture is essential in mobile app development to make it less prone to errors, ensuring flexibility, scalability and maintainability. Well structured components promote modularity, simplyfing app development.

To achieve that, the architecture used in the development of this app follows principles suggested in the [Google Guide to App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

Our app is mostly divided into the following components:

### Screen

What the user sees amd interacts with on their device. Contains all the visual interface definition and structure and components such as buttons, text fields, etc.

### View Model

The view model acts as a middleman between the UI and the data. Contains the business logic required to transform raw data into a appropriate format to be presented in the UI.
By acting as a middleman, it provides a **separation of concerns** which increases app modularity.

### Use Case

Optional layer that contains reusable business logic. It is used when appropriate to reduce code duplication and increase code reusability.

### Repositories

Repositories provide a easy way to access data. They contain methods for fetching, updating and deleting data.
Their usage allows us to abstract the data sources, making it easier to switch between different data sources.
They can also use network and local data sources to provide local first data access, even when offline.

### Data Sources

Data sources are the data providers for the app. They include databases and network REST APIs. Data sources are the data providers that repositories use to retrieve and store data. In the context of our app, since it needs to communicate with a server, but also needs to work offline two kinds of data sources are being used: network data sources and local data sources.

#### Network

Data retrieved from any other source that is not the user's device. Allows real-time updates and access of information that is not locally stored.

#### Local

Data stored on the user's device. This kind of data source enables offline access and faster retrieval.

### Work Manager

Work Manager allows us to schedule tasks that run in the background, not necessarily tied to any of the app's components. It is used to perform synchronization tasks with the server, but also to delete personal information when the user logs out.

### Model

Models represent the data that is being used in the app. They give us type safety and help us to avoid errors when working with data.

## Modularization

Because multiple apps were developed in parallel, they were divided into several modules to make it easier to manage, maintain, and reuse code. 

The modules fall into three main categories:

### App Modules

The app modules are the main modules that contain the code specific to each app/service.

For example, the `app:main` module contains the code for the main app, while the `app:backend` module contains the code for the backend server.

These modules are:

- **app:backend**: Contains the code for the backend server.
- **app:cafeteria**: Contains the code for the cafeteria terminal.
- **app:main**: Contains the code for the main app.
- **app:tickets**: Contains the code for the ticket terminal.

### Feature Modules

The feature modules contain the code for the different features of the main app.
Each feature module contains the code for a different feature, and these are totally independent from each other.
This way, if a feature is not needed, it can be easily removed without affecting the rest of the app.

These modules are:

- **feature:auth**: Contains the code for the authentication feature.
- **feature:cafeteria**: Contains the code for the cafeteria feature.
- **feature:events**: Contains the code for the events feature.
- **feature:profile**: Contains the code for the profile feature.
- **feature:tickets**: Contains the code for the tickets feature.

### Core Modules

The core modules contain the code that can be shared between the different modules.
This way, the code is not duplicated, and it is easier to maintain and update.

These modules are:

- **core:app**: Contains the code that is shared between the different app modules, such as helpers for Applications and Activities.
- **core:data**: Contains the code for the different data repositories used throughout the apps.
- **core:database**: Contains the code for the database used by the backend server.
- **core:domain**: Contains the code for the different use cases used throughout the apps.
- **core:local**: Contains the code for the different local data sources used throughout the apps.
- **core:model**: Contains the code for the different models used throughout the apps.
- **core:network**: Contains the code for the different network data sources used throughout the apps.
- **core:ui**: Contains the code for the common UI components used throughout the apps.

## Data Schemas

### Server Database

#### ☕ Cafeteria Item

Cafeteria Items are stored in the database with a string ID, which is the primary key, the item name (Name), price (Price) stored as an integer (because the price is stored in the database as cents of euro and converted for euros everytime it is shown to the user), and an image URL (Image Url) to represent the item visually.
